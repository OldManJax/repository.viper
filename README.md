# Viper Repository

This is a small repository to host the Viper Scrapers add-on.

Viper Scrapers is a fork of CoCoScrapers for use in any add-on that uses CoCoScrapers. It has been forked to upgrade providers using code from Kodifitzwell. Specifically the Comet, Mediafusion, Knightcrawler, Zilean and AIOstreams scrapers. 

I can not create scrapers myself, I simply pulled together what was created by others with very simple code changes. If anyone knows how to create a new torrent scraper, feel free to contribute.
